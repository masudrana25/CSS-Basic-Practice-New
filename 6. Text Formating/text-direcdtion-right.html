  <!-- Text Direction -->

    <h1> Write Text From Right Arabic or Hebrew languages</h1>
    <h2 style="direction: rtl;unicode-bidi: bidi-override;">مرحبًا بك في مثال النص</h2>
    <div>
      Remember that using "direction: rtl;" will change the overall layout direction of the element and its children,
      affecting not only the text but also the alignment, positioning, and ordering of various elements within the
      container. If you're
      dealing with bidirectional text and need more control over how characters are rendered, you might combine
      "direction: rtl;" with the unicode-bidi property, as previously explained "unicode-bidi: bidi-override;".
